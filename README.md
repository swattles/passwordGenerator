> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

Thank you for all of your feedback and attention to my work. I hope you enjoy! 

Have a fantastic day!
